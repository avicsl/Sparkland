**Sparkland Amusement Park Booking System**  

Sparkland is a web-based amusement park booking system designed to streamline ticket reservations and park entry management. Inspired by the exciting experience of theme parks, Sparkland allows users to explore ticket options, book passes, manage reservations, and access essential park information.  

This project is developed as the final requirement for our **Data Structures and Algorithms** course, showcasing our expertise in efficient data handling, queue management, and system optimization. The system incorporates **priority queues** for ticket processing, **linked lists** for reservation management, and **search and sorting algorithms** to enhance user experience.  

Currently, **this project does not include a database**, meaning all data is stored in-memory during runtime. This presents an area for future improvement, as implementing a database would allow for persistent storage, better scalability, and enhanced user experience.

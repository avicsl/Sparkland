# Sparkland Amusement Park Booking System

**Sparkland** is a desktop-based amusement park booking system developed to simplify ticket reservations and manage park entry efficiently. Inspired by the vibrant energy of theme parks, the system allows users to explore ticket options, book passes, handle reservations, and access essential park information.

## Project Overview

Created as the **final requirement for our Data Structures and Algorithms course**, this project showcases the practical application of fundamental data structures in building a functional, real-world ticketing system.

Rather than focusing on web or mobile platforms, Sparkland emphasizes backend logic and in-memory data handling using Java.

## Key Features

- **Ticket Booking Interface**: Book different types of tickets (e.g., Regular, VIP, PWD, Senior, Pregnant).
- **Priority Queue Management**: Ensures faster processing for priority customers like PWDs and seniors.
- **Reservation Tracking**: Uses linked lists to store and manage active reservations.
- **Search and Sorting Algorithms**: Enables efficient lookup and organization of bookings.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **NetBeans (Java SE)**: The sole development environment used for building the system and designing the interface.

## Current Limitations

- **No Database Integration**: All data is temporarily stored in memory and is cleared after the program ends.
- **No User Accounts or Authentication**: Future enhancements may include user login and profile management.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate a **database** for persistent data storage and enhanced scalability.
- Implement **report generation** for booking analytics.
- Add **user accounts** and **ticket validation features**.
